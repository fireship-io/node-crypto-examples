///// Challenge /////

// Below is a hash 
// Use your hacking skills to crack it!

// Steps to crack the hash
// Find out what type of algorithm is used to generate hash code
// Normally this can be found using length of hash generated
// given hash is 32 characters long so it is MD5
const hash = '5e7d28e2cfff93edefb2d15abad07ec5';


// When you figure it out, create a Pull Request on github with value. 
// First correct PR wins a Lifetime PRO  membership and T-shirt

///// ANSWER /////
// Cracking the hash is very easy
// Goto https://www.md5online.org/md5-decrypt.html and enter the hash
// This will give you the string that is hashed
// Finally thanks for the challenge
